    <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-700">
        <p>The resurrection of Jesus Christ is the central event of the Christian faith, demonstrating His power over death and validating His claims of divinity. This extraordinary event not only fulfilled ancient prophecies but also established the foundations for the Christian hope in eternal life.</p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4 text-indigo-700">The Event of the Resurrection</h3>
        <p>All four gospels (Matthew 28, Mark 16, Luke 24, John 20) report the resurrection of Jesus. After His crucifixion and death on Friday, Jesus was buried. On Sunday morning, women went to the tomb and found it empty. Angels announced that Jesus had risen, and He subsequently appeared to His disciples and many others.</p>
        <p>The apostle Paul, in 1 Corinthians 15:3-8, provides a concise summary of Jesus' post-resurrection appearances, mentioning that He was seen by more than 500 people at once, in addition to appearing to individuals and smaller groups.</p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4 text-indigo-700">Power Over Death</h3>
        <p>Jesus' resurrection demonstrates His power over death in several ways:</p>

        <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-2">
            <li>Fulfillment of Prophecies: Jesus predicted His own death and resurrection (Mark 8:31, John 2:19-21), fulfilling these prophecies and demonstrating His control over events.</li>
            <li>Victory Over Sin: The resurrection proves that Jesus' sacrifice was accepted by God as atonement for sin. "He was delivered over to death for our sins and was raised to life for our justification" (Romans 4:25).</li>
            <li>Conquest of Death: Paul declares in 1 Corinthians 15:54-55, "Where, O death, is your victory? Where, O death, is your sting?" Jesus' resurrection broke the power of death over humanity.</li>
            <li>Promise of Future Resurrection: Jesus' resurrection is the guarantee of the future resurrection of believers. "Christ has indeed been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep" (1 Corinthians 15:20).</li>
        </ol>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4 text-indigo-700">Implications of the Resurrection</h3>
        <p>Jesus' resurrection has profound implications for the Christian faith:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
            <li>Validation of Jesus' Divinity: The resurrection confirms Jesus' claims about His divinity (John 10:30).</li>
            <li>Foundation of Faith: Paul states that without the resurrection, the Christian faith would be in vain (1 Corinthians 15:14).</li>
            <li>Hope of Eternal Life: Jesus' resurrection provides believers with the hope of eternal life (1 Peter 1:3-4).</li>
            <li>Power for Christian Living: Believers can live in "newness of life" because of the resurrection (Romans 6:4).</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="mt-6">In conclusion, Jesus' resurrection is the central event that demonstrates His power over death. This miraculous event not only validated Jesus' claims and fulfilled prophecies but also established the foundations for the Christian faith, offering hope of eternal life and power for the daily lives of believers. The resurrection remains a powerful testimony to God's love and His final victory over sin and death.</p>
