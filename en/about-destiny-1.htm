            <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-700">
                <p>The Bible teaches that there are two final destinies for man: one with God and one without God.
                    These destinies are eternal life in the presence of God, in the new heavens and new earth, and eternal separation from God, in the lake of fire.</p>

                <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4 text-indigo-700">The Destiny with God: New Heavens and New Earth</h3>
                <p>The Bible describes that God will come down to dwell with men in the new Jerusalem, part of the new heavens and new earth.
                    Revelation 21:1-4 says: "Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and there was no longer any sea.
                    I saw the Holy City, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride beautifully dressed for her husband.
                    And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, 'Look! God’s dwelling place is now among the people, and he will dwell with them. They will be his people, and God himself will be with them and be their God.
                    ‘He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death’ or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away."</p>

                <p>In this new state, believers will enjoy perfect and eternal communion with God, free from suffering, pain, and death.
                    God's promise is to restore creation, bringing eternal peace and justice.</p>

                <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4 text-indigo-700">The Destiny without God: The Lake of Fire</h3>
                <p>The lake of fire is described in the Bible as a place of eternal separation from God, where there is suffering and anguish.
                    Revelation 20:15 states: "Anyone whose name was not found written in the book of life was thrown into the lake of fire."</p>

                <p>The lake of fire is a place of eternal punishment for those who reject the offer of salvation in Jesus Christ.
                    In 2 Thessalonians 1:9, Paul writes: "They will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut out from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his might."</p>

                <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4 text-indigo-700">The Choice of Each Individual</h3>
                <p>God offers salvation to all, but each individual must choose to accept or reject this offer.
                    John 3:16 states: "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life."
                    Acceptance of salvation results in eternal life with God, while rejection results in eternal separation from Him.</p>

                <p>Jesus emphasized the importance of this choice in Matthew 7:13-14:
                    "Enter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it.
                    But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life, and only a few find it."</p>

                <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4 text-indigo-700">Living with Eternity in Mind</h3>
                <p>Believers are called to live with eternity in mind, seeking God and sharing the message of salvation with others.
                    In Colossians 3:1-2, Paul exhorts: "Since, then, you have been raised with Christ, set your hearts on things above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God.
                    Set your minds on things above, not on earthly things."</p>

                <p class="mt-6">In conclusion, the Bible teaches that there are only two final destinies for man: with God in the new heavens and new earth or without God in the lake of fire.
                    This reality places before each individual the most important decision of their lives - to accept or reject the offer of salvation in Jesus Christ.
                    Those who choose to accept will live eternally in the presence of God, while those who reject will face eternal separation from His love and presence.</p>
