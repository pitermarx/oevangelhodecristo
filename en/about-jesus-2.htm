    <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-700">
        <p>The crucifixion of Jesus Christ is the central event of the Christian faith. His death on the cross was not just a historical event, but a divine act of redemption that made reconciliation between God and humanity possible.</p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4 text-indigo-700">The Crucifixion of Jesus</h3>
        <p>The four gospels describe the crucifixion of Jesus in detail (Matthew 27, Mark 15, Luke 23, John 19). He was unjustly condemned, flogged, and crucified - an extremely cruel form of Roman execution. Jesus suffered not only physical pain but also spiritual anguish, crying out: "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" (Mark 15:34).</p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4 text-indigo-700">For Our Sins</h3>
        <p>The Bible teaches that Jesus' death was not an accident, but an intentional act to deal with the problem of human sin. Isaiah prophesied: "He was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities" (Isaiah 53:5). Paul states: "Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures" (1 Corinthians 15:3).</p>
        <p>Sin created a separation between God and humanity (Isaiah 59:2). God's justice demands punishment for sin, but His love seeks to save sinners. On the cross, Jesus, being without sin, took upon Himself the punishment we deserved. Peter writes: "He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree" (1 Peter 2:24).</p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4 text-indigo-700">Enabling Our Reconciliation with God</h3>
        <p>Jesus' death on the cross opened the way for reconciliation between God and humanity. Paul explains: "When we were God's enemies, we were reconciled to him through the death of his Son" (Romans 5:10). This reconciliation restores the relationship that was broken by sin.</p>
        <p>The cross simultaneously demonstrates God's justice and love. Justice is satisfied because sin is punished; love is demonstrated because God Himself, in Christ, bears the punishment. John summarizes: "This is love: not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins" (1 John 4:10).</p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4 text-indigo-700">Our Response</h3>
        <p>The reconciliation offered through Christ's cross requires a human response. Paul writes: "God was reconciling the world to himself in Christ... Be reconciled to God" (2 Corinthians 5:19-20). This reconciliation is received through repentance and faith in Jesus Christ.</p>

        <p class="mt-6">In conclusion, the crucifixion of Jesus is the means by which God decisively dealt with the problem of human sin. Through His sacrificial death, Jesus paid the penalty for sin and opened the way for human beings to be reconciled to God. This central truth of the gospel offers hope of forgiveness, restoration, and eternal life to all who believe.</p>
