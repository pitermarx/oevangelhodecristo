            <h2 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-6 text-indigo-800">God is Love. God is Holiness</h2>

        <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-700">
            <p>The nature of God is multifaceted, but two fundamental characteristics that define His character are love and holiness. These qualities, seemingly opposite, coexist perfectly in God, revealing the depth and complexity of His being.</p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4 text-indigo-700">God is Love</h3>
            <p>The statement "God is love" is explicitly found in the First Epistle of John: "Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love" (1 John 4:8). This declaration not only describes a characteristic of God but defines His very essence.</p>
            
            <p>God's love manifests in various ways throughout the Scriptures:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
                <li>In creation, where God forms human beings in His image and likeness (Genesis 1:27).</li>
                <li>In redemption, where God offers His Son for the salvation of humanity: "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life" (John 3:16).</li>
                <li>In the mercy and grace He extends to sinners: "But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us" (Romans 5:8).</li>
            </ul>

            <p>God's love is unconditional, sacrificial, and eternal. It does not depend on human actions but flows from God's very nature.</p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4 text-indigo-700">God is Holiness</h3>
            <p>The holiness of God is another fundamental aspect of His nature. "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord Almighty; the whole earth is full of his glory" (Isaiah 6:3). The triple repetition of "holy" in Isaiah's vision emphasizes the absolute holiness of God.</p>
            
            <p>God's holiness implies:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
                <li>Separation: God is completely other, transcendent, and above all creation.</li>
                <li>Moral purity: God is absolutely pure, without any stain of sin or imperfection.</li>
                <li>Justice: God's holiness demands justice and cannot tolerate sin.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>God's holiness is so central to His nature that the Scriptures often refer to Him as "The Holy One of Israel" (Isaiah 43:3). This holiness sets a standard for His people: "Be holy, because I am holy" (1 Peter 1:16).</p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4 text-indigo-700">The Harmony between Love and Holiness</h3>
            <p>At first glance, God's love and holiness might seem contradictory. How can a holy God love sinners? How can a loving God judge sin? The answer lies in the cross of Christ, where God's love and holiness meet in perfect harmony.</p>

            <p>At the cross, we see:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
                <li>God's love demonstrated in the sacrifice of His Son for sinners.</li>
                <li>God's holiness upheld through the just judgment of sin.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Thus, through Jesus Christ, God satisfies the demands of His holiness while extending His love to fallen humanity. "God was reconciling the world to himself in Christ" (2 Corinthians 5:19).</p>

            <p class="mt-6">In conclusion, God's love and holiness are not mutually exclusive characteristics but complementary aspects of His perfect nature. Together, they reveal a God who is both transcendent and intimate, just and merciful, worthy of reverence and worship.</p>
