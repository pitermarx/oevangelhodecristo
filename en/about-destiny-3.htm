    <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mb-6">
        <li>With the help of the Holy Spirit who now dwells in them</li>

    </ul>

<div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-700">
    <p>A true believer in Jesus Christ not only recognizes sin but also desires to abandon it and live a life that honors God.
        This desire for sanctification is fueled by the presence of the Holy Spirit and the support of the church community.</p>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4 text-indigo-700">The Help of the Holy Spirit</h3>
    <p>When a person believes in Jesus Christ, the Holy Spirit comes to dwell in them.
        In John 14:16-17, Jesus says, "And I will pray to the Father, and He will give you another Helper, that He may abide with you forever;
        the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it neither sees Him nor knows Him; but you know Him, for He dwells with you and will be in you."</p>

    <p>The Holy Spirit helps believers resist sin and live according to God's will.
        In Galatians 5:16, Paul exhorts, "I say then: Walk in the Spirit, and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh."
        The Holy Spirit provides power and guidance to overcome temptations and transform the believer's life.</p>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4 text-indigo-700">The Help of the Church</h3>
    <p>The church, as the body of Christ, plays a vital role in the spiritual growth of believers.
        Fellowship with other Christians offers encouragement, teaching, and support.
        In Hebrews 10:24-25, the Bible instructs us, "And let us consider one another in order to stir up love and good works,
        not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as is the manner of some, but exhorting one another, and so much the more as you see the Day approaching."</p>

    <p>Through biblical teaching, prayer, and mutual support, the church helps believers grow in faith and turn away from sin.
        In James 5:16, we read, "Confess your trespasses to one another, and pray for one another, that you may be healed. The effective, fervent prayer of a righteous man avails much."</p>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4 text-indigo-700">The Path of Sanctification</h3>
    <p>Sanctification is an ongoing process in the life of a believer, involving becoming more like Christ.
        In Philippians 1:6, Paul writes, "Being confident of this very thing, that He who has begun a good work in you will complete it until the day of Jesus Christ."</p>

    <p>This process is a partnership between the believer, who seeks to live according to the Word of God, and the Holy Spirit, who provides the necessary power and guidance.
        The church, as a community of believers, offers a supportive and encouraging environment essential for this journey.</p>

    <p class="mt-6">In conclusion, a true believer will desire to remove sin from their life, and they will do so with the help of the Holy Spirit who dwells in them
        and with the help of the church that can encourage and teach them. This pursuit of sanctification is a distinguishing mark of the Christian life,
        reflecting the desire to live according to God's will and grow in likeness to Christ.</p>
