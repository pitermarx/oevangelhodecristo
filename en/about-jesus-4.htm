    <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-700">
        <p>The second coming of Jesus Christ is a central belief in the Christian faith, where He will return to rule and judge the world. This future event is mentioned in several biblical passages and is awaited with great anticipation by believers.</p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4 text-indigo-700">Promises of the Second Coming</h3>
        <p>The Bible contains several promises about Jesus' return. In John 14:3, Jesus says: "And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come back and take you to be with me that you also may be where I am." This promise assures believers that Jesus will return to take them to be with Him.</p>
        <p>In Acts 1:11, after Jesus' ascension, two angels told the disciples: "This same Jesus, who has been taken from you into heaven, will come back in the same way you have seen him go into heaven." This statement reaffirms the promise of Jesus' physical and visible return.</p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4 text-indigo-700">The Righteous Ruler</h3>
        <p>When Jesus returns, He will rule the world with justice and equity. Isaiah 9:6-7 prophesies: "For to us a child is born, to us a son is given, and the government will be on his shoulders. And he will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace. Of the greatness of his government and peace there will be no end. He will reign on David's throne and over his kingdom, establishing and upholding it with justice and righteousness from that time on and forever." This government will be characterized by peace and divine justice.</p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4 text-indigo-700">The Judge of All the Earth</h3>
        <p>The second coming of Jesus also involves the judgment of all people. In Matthew 25:31-32, Jesus describes this event: "When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, he will sit on his glorious throne. All the nations will be gathered before him, and he will separate the people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats."</p>
        <p>This judgment will be based on God's perfect justice. Those who have trusted in Jesus for salvation will be rewarded, while those who have rejected Him will face eternal condemnation (Matthew 25:46).</p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4 text-indigo-700">Preparation for the Second Coming</h3>
        <p>The Bible exhorts believers to be prepared for Jesus' return. In Matthew 24:44, Jesus warns: "So you also must be ready, because the Son of Man will come at an hour when you do not expect him." This preparation involves living a life of holiness and service to God, eagerly awaiting Christ's return.</p>
        <p>In 2 Peter 3:11-12, believers are encouraged to live godly lives: "Since everything will be destroyed in this way, what kind of people ought you to be? You ought to live holy and godly lives as you look forward to the day of God and speed its coming."</p>

        <p class="mt-6">In conclusion, the second coming of Jesus Christ is an event awaited with great hope by believers. He will return to rule with justice and judge all people, establishing His eternal kingdom. Believers are called to live in preparation for this event, trusting in Jesus' promises and eagerly awaiting His return.</p>
