    <h2 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-6 text-indigo-800">Man is Separated from God Because of Sin</h2>

<div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-700">
    <p>One of the most profound consequences of sin is the separation it creates between man and God. This fundamental truth lies at the heart of the Christian understanding of the human condition and the need for reconciliation with God.</p>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4 text-indigo-700">Biblical Foundation</h3>
    <p>The Bible is clear about the separation caused by sin:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
        <li>Isaiah 59:2: "But your iniquities have separated you from your God; your sins have hidden his face from you, so that he will not hear."</li>
        <li>Romans 3:23: "For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God."</li>
        <li>Ephesians 2:12: "Remember that at that time you were separate from Christ, excluded from citizenship in Israel and foreigners to the covenants of the promise, without hope and without God in the world."</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4 text-indigo-700">The Origin of Separation</h3>
    <p>The separation between man and God originates from the fall of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden (Genesis 3). Before the fall, Adam and Eve enjoyed perfect communion with God. After sinning, they hid from God, illustrating the immediate separation that sin causes.</p>
    
    <p>This separation was then transmitted to all humanity: "Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin, and in this way death came to all people, because all sinned" (Romans 5:12).</p>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4 text-indigo-700">The Manifestations of Separation</h3>
    <p>Separation from God manifests in various ways:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
        <li>Spiritual death (Ephesians 2:1)</li>
        <li>Inability to understand spiritual things (1 Corinthians 2:14)</li>
        <li>Fear and shame before God (Genesis 3:8-10)</li>
        <li>Alienation from God and hostility towards Him (Colossians 1:21)</li>
        <li>Loss of purpose and meaning in life (Ecclesiastes 1:2)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4 text-indigo-700">The Implications of Separation</h3>
    <p>Separation from God has profound implications:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
        <li>Inability to attain salvation through one's own efforts (Ephesians 2:8-9)</li>
        <li>Inability to live a life pleasing to God on one's own (Romans 8:8)</li>
        <li>Subjection to God's judgment (Romans 2:5)</li>
        <li>Loss of peace and fullness that come from a relationship with God (Philippians 4:7)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4 text-indigo-700">God's Solution for Separation</h3>
    <p>Despite the severity of the separation caused by sin, God provided a means of reconciliation through Jesus Christ:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
        <li>"But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far away have been brought near by the blood of Christ" (Ephesians 2:13).</li>
        <li>"That God was reconciling the world to himself in Christ, not counting people's sins against them" (2 Corinthians 5:19).</li>
        <li>"For there is one God and one mediator between God and mankind, the man Christ Jesus" (1 Timothy 2:5).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Through faith in Christ, believers are reconciled to God, the separation is overcome, and a new relationship with God is established.</p>

    <p class="mt-6">In conclusion, the separation between man and God due to sin is a tragic reality, but it is not the end of the story. The Gospel of Jesus Christ offers the promise of reconciliation, restoring the lost relationship between God and humanity. This truth highlights the gravity of sin, the depth of God's love, and the crucial need to respond to God's offer of salvation in Christ.</p>
