        <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-700">
            <p>The idea that God rewards those who seek Him is a recurring theme in Scripture and a fundamental principle of the Christian faith. This truth not only encourages believers to diligently seek God, but also reveals the character of a God who desires to be found and known by His creation.</p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4 text-indigo-700">Biblical Foundation</h3>
            <p>The concept of God rewarding those who seek Him is explicitly stated in Hebrews 11:6: "And without faith it is impossible to please God, because anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him." This passage not only affirms that God rewards, but also establishes the pursuit of God as an act of faith.</p>
            
            <p>Other passages that reinforce this truth include:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
                <li>Jeremiah 29:13: "You will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart."</li>
                <li>Deuteronomy 4:29: "But if from there you seek the Lord your God, you will find him if you seek him with all your heart and with all your soul."</li>
                <li>Proverbs 8:17: "I love those who love me, and those who seek me find me."</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4 text-indigo-700">What Does It Mean to Seek God?</h3>
            <p>Seeking God is not a physical search, but a spiritual one. It involves:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
                <li>Sincere and constant prayer (Colossians 4:2)</li>
                <li>Study and meditation on the Scriptures (Psalm 119:15-16)</li>
                <li>Worship and praise (Psalm 95:6-7)</li>
                <li>Obedience to God's commandments (John 14:15)</li>
                <li>Seeking God's will in all areas of life (Proverbs 3:5-6)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4 text-indigo-700">The Rewards of God</h3>
            <p>God's rewards for those who seek Him are multifaceted and profound:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
                <li>Salvation and eternal life (John 3:16)</li>
                <li>Peace that surpasses all understanding (Philippians 4:7)</li>
                <li>Guidance and wisdom (James 1:5)</li>
                <li>Strength and courage (Isaiah 41:10)</li>
                <li>Intimacy with God (James 4:8)</li>
                <li>Purpose and meaning in life (Jeremiah 29:11)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>It is important to note that these rewards are not necessarily material or immediate. The greatest reward is God Himself - knowing Him, experiencing His love, and living in His presence.</p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4 text-indigo-700">Grace in the Pursuit</h3>
            <p>Although God rewards those who seek Him, it is crucial to understand that our ability to seek God comes from His grace. Romans 3:11 states: "There is no one who understands; there is no one who seeks God." Our search for God is a response to His initiative to seek us first (Luke 19:10).</p>

            <p>God's grace enables us to seek Him, and His faithfulness ensures that we will be rewarded when we do. As Jesus said: "Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you" (Matthew 7:7).</p>

            <p class="mt-6">In conclusion, the promise that God rewards those who seek Him is a powerful invitation to pursue a deeper relationship with Him. It is a testament to the loving and generous nature of God, who not only allows us to find Him but promises to reward our efforts. This truth motivates us to persist in faith, confident that our search for God is never in vain.</p>
