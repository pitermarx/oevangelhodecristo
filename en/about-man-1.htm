<div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-700">
    <p>The doctrine that all human beings sin, or break God's law, is fundamental to the Christian understanding of the human condition and the need for salvation. This truth is clearly taught in the Scriptures and has profound implications for our relationship with God and with one another.</p>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4 text-indigo-700">Biblical Foundation</h3>
    <p>The Bible repeatedly affirms the universality of human sin:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
        <li>Romans 3:23: "For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God."</li>
        <li>Ecclesiastes 7:20: "There is not a righteous man on earth who does what is right and never sins."</li>
        <li>1 John 1:8: "If we claim to be without sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us."</li>
        <li>Isaiah 53:6: "We all, like sheep, have gone astray, each of us has turned to our own way."</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4 text-indigo-700">What is Sin?</h3>
    <p>Sin, in essence, is any thought, word, or action that violates God's law or falls short of His perfection. It includes both acts of commission (doing what is forbidden) and omission (failing to do what is commanded).</p>
    
    <p>The Bible describes sin in various ways:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
        <li>Transgression of God's law (1 John 3:4)</li>
        <li>Rebellion against God (Deuteronomy 9:7)</li>
        <li>Failure to do good (James 4:17)</li>
        <li>Unbelief (Romans 14:23)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4 text-indigo-700">The Consequences of Sin</h3>
    <p>Sin has several serious consequences:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
        <li>Separation from God (Isaiah 59:2)</li>
        <li>Spiritual and physical death (Romans 6:23)</li>
        <li>Guilt and shame (Genesis 3:7-8)</li>
        <li>Corruption of creation (Romans 8:20-22)</li>
        <li>Divine judgment (Romans 2:5-6)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4 text-indigo-700">God's Response to Sin</h3>
    <p>Despite the universality of sin, the central message of the Gospel is that God has provided a remedy through Jesus Christ. "But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us" (Romans 5:8).</p>
    
    <p>Through faith in Christ, sinners can receive forgiveness, reconciliation with God, and the promise of eternal life (John 3:16, Ephesians 2:8-9).</p>

    <p class="mt-6">In conclusion, the doctrine that all humans break God's law (sin) is a fundamental biblical truth. It reveals our universal need for a Savior and magnifies God's grace and love in providing redemption through Jesus Christ. This truth reminds us of our continual dependence on God's grace and calls us to humility, repentance, and gratitude for the salvation offered in Christ.</p>
