    <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-700">
        <p>The assertion that God cannot leave humanity's sin unpunished is fundamental to understanding God's nature, the gravity of sin, and the need for salvation. This truth is deeply rooted in Scripture and has significant implications for the Christian faith.</p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4 text-indigo-700">The Holiness of God</h3>
        <p>To understand why God cannot leave sin unpunished, we must first comprehend God's holiness. The Bible repeatedly emphasizes that God is holy (Isaiah 6:3; Revelation 4:8). This holiness means that God is perfectly pure and separated from all evil. As Habakkuk 1:13 declares, "Your eyes are too pure to look on evil; you cannot tolerate wrongdoing." God's holiness requires that He oppose sin in all its forms.</p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4 text-indigo-700">The Justice of God</h3>
        <p>Closely tied to God's holiness is His justice. God is described as a righteous judge (Psalm 7:11) who judges with righteousness (Psalm 9:8). God's justice requires that sin be punished. As Romans 6:23 states, "the wages of sin is death". Ignoring or leaving sin unpunished would be a violation of God's very just nature.</p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4 text-indigo-700">The Gravity of Sin</h3>
        <p>Sin is not a trivial matter in God's eyes. It is a rebellion against the Creator, a violation of His perfect law, and a corruption of His creation. As Paul explains in Romans 3:23, "all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God". Sin not only separates us from God (Isaiah 59:2), but also brings condemnation (John 3:18). The gravity of sin demands a divine response.</p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4 text-indigo-700">The Divine Dilemma</h3>
        <p>The combination of God's holiness, His justice, and the gravity of sin creates what we might call a "divine dilemma". How can a loving and merciful God (1 John 4:8) also be just and holy, punishing sin as it deserves? The answer to this dilemma is found in the cross of Jesus Christ.</p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4 text-indigo-700">The Solution on the Cross</h3>
        <p>On the cross, we see the supreme demonstration of both God's justice and love. As Paul explains in Romans 3:25-26, God presented Jesus as a sacrifice of atonement "to demonstrate his righteousness... so as to be just and the one who justifies those who have faith in Jesus". On the cross, sin is punished - Jesus bears the penalty in our place - and mercy is extended to sinners.</p>

        <p class="mt-6">In conclusion, God cannot leave sin unpunished because it would violate His holy and just nature. However, in His infinite wisdom and love, God provided a way to satisfy the demands of justice and offer forgiveness to sinners through the sacrifice of Jesus Christ. This truth is at the heart of the gospel and reminds us of the seriousness of sin, the holiness of God, and the wonder of divine grace.</p>
